    <body>
      <div>I have decided to tell you about my past trips but especially about my future trip.
          I have travelled a lot in recent years, I have travelled to almost all European capitals, 
          I have lived a lot of time in Southern Africa and South Africa. But now I want to go to South America and mainly to Bolivia. 
          In the centre of Latin America, Bolivia offers incredible diversity with breathtaking cultural richness.

      <h1>Location</h1>

      <p>Bolivia, officially the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a sovereign country located in the central-western region of South America.
        It is constituted as a plurinational, decentralized state with autonomies. It is organized in nine departments. 
        Its constitutional capital is Sucre, seat of the judicial body; the city of La Paz is the seat of the executive, 
        legislative and electoral bodies. 
        Bolivia is surrounded by several countries:
          - Brazil in the Northeast
          - Paraguay, Chile and Argentina in the South 
          - Peru in the West
       </p>

  <h1>The languages spoken in the country</h1>

  <p>The official language is Spanish, but Bolivia recognizes 37 languages in its country, 
    including all the languages of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia.
      The most widely spoken indigenous languages are Quechua, Aymara and Guaran√≠.

  <h1>The culture</h1>

  <p>In Bolivia there are about forty ethnic groups, which in many cases preserve their traditions, cultures and languages.
    Bolivia has a considerable indigenous influence in all its cultural variants.
    The Bolivian culture is very varied. This is due to the mixture of the ancestral traditions of the different indigenous groups, 
    but also to the importation of European products that have impregnated the habits of the Bolivians. 
  </p>

   <h2>Heritage</h2>
   <p>Bolivia has a very rich and diverse history and that is why it has so much heritage protected by UNESCO.
    The State is committed to the promotion of all the country's tangible and intangible heritage for all groups (indigenous and non-indigenous) 
    and promotes the recognition, rescue, recreation, preservation, integrated conservation, access and dissemination of cultural heritage as a right of all the country's inhabitants.

   <h2>The Art - Carnival</h2>
   <p>Art is very present throughout the country. Painting, sculpture, literature and music are protected and promoted throughout the country. 
    The architecture is also very specific to Bolivia. Many architectural styles are visible in this country. 
    Like Tiwanaku, a building that is part of an ancient capital of the Tiahuanacota State or Incallajta, an Inca construction. 
    Today, the neotiahuanaco style and official academism are widely used to build Bolivian monuments or museums.
